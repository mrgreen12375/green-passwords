## Discription 

This prodject was to create a webpage that generates multi. character passwords using javascript. The techniques used to produce a functioning password generator are as follows. Create the initial prompt using window.prompt to add the amount of characters you want the password length to be. Create a prompt to show if the user typed a number or the correct length to move to the character prompts. Then I made multiple confirm prompts to for the user to select special, numeric, lowercase or uppercase characters. I made that by using window.confirm, character variables and if statments to select the users options. I used mathmatical functions and for loops to randimize the users character selections.
